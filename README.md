Software Engineering - Quiz App
--------------------------------

This quiz-taking app designed for Android fetches JSON-Formatted questions from a remote server and provides an intuitive user interface. Moreover, it allows you to create your own questions and send them to the server.

Designed in a team of five people, the application has been widely tested using test-driven development. We also used various development techniques such as eXtreme Programming and Aglie methods.
This work was part of a software engineering class of EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne). Building this app was a rich experience, on a coding level as well as for it's teamwork aspect.
