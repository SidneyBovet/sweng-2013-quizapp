This quizz-taking app designed for Android fetches JSON-Formatted questions from a remote server and provides an intuitive user interface. Moreover, it allows to create your own questions and send them to the server.

Designed in a team of five people, the application has been widely tested using test-driven development. We also used various development techniques such as Xtreme Programming and Aglie methods.
